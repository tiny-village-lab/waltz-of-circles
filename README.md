Waltz of circles
================

Avoid enemies by sneaking between them, and make them collide to destroy them.

The pulse of the game is tied to the tempo of the music. So I hope you have a sense of rhythm, because that's the best way out...

How to play
-----------

[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/jnp3Fz3__N4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnp3Fz3__N4)

Use the joystick in the lower right to move the player. Use the power that allows you to transform into a ghost to set traps for your enemies, and to escape them.

### Act like a ghost

The use of phantom power is limited to a maximum of 4 beats (1 measure). Then you will have to wait for it to recharge one step per beat.

### LifeÂ points

Your life points are 5 maximum. Each time you get hit by an enemy, you lose a life point. A life point is recovered every 10 beats.

Project life
============

The project is in its first prototype. For now, 10 levels are playable.

Music matters
-------------

One of the goals of this project is to use adaptive music. To do this, I use FMOD: an audio engine well integrated with Unity.

If you focus on the details, you will be able to notice that the entire game is punctuated by the soundtrack.

The actions on the screen also influence the music, such as when we use the ghost power, or when the intensity increases.

Roadmap of features
-------------------

Here is the list of features that I will implement:

-   Different levels and procedural generation of levels
-   Pause the game
-   More enemy types with different behaviors
-   Different soundtracks
